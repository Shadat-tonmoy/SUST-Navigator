# SUST-Navigator
Way back to 2014...SUST Navigator was first Developed by someone else with a dataset inputted as hard coded :( 
which could never be updated without the Developer. This Version is focusing on solving this issue!! 
Using firebase this app will provide synchronization upon each user with the latest data which can be updated 
from the app without the help of developer.It also has OCR that will help the admin to scan syllabus book and generate course
by just dragging and dropping. User can also have their local database to store course record.
